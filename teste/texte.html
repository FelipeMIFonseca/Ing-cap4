          <p class='general-text'>Getting to know different cultures and the way people think in other regions can help
            you open your mind to new ideas and ways of living, transforming you into a more thoughtful human being.
            Spending time away from home makes you leave your comfort zone and adopt new habits. </p>
          <p class='general-text'>For instance, if you travel to a different state in your own country, you may face
            some challenges, such as eating exotic meals or listening to people speak with a different accent and use
            words you are not familiar with. As you visit a foreign country, you may need to experience contrasting
            customs, communicate in another language, get used to a distinctive weather, and so on. Overcoming the
            difficulties may increase your self-esteem and make you proud of yourself!</p>
          <p class='general-text'>According to neurologist José Manuel Molto, member of the SENC (Spanish Society of
            Neuroscienc, it is important to train and stimulate your brain so that neurons can create new connections
            throughout life, which may keep your brain young. Simple situations provided by traveling, such as adapting
            to new sensations, landscapes, sounds and aromas, can be invigorating to your gray matter and make your
            brain more plastic and creative. </p>

                    <secao_titulo_citado>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRIENDS AND TYPES OF FRIENDSHIP</secao_titulo_citado>
                    <p class='quote'>Everyone has at least one best friend, some maybe even more. There are also those
                      people who are just friends and also arch-enemies. People may think that just because they are
                      your friends it means that they are your best friend. The thing is, even though they are your
                      friend, the relationship between a best friend and a friend is different. Either way regardless of
                      arch-enemies, friends or best friends, there are not many ways to compare any of these different
                      types of friends, but you can easily contrast them from one another.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>Arch-enemies often know more about each other than two friends. In a comparison of
                      personal relationships, friendship is considered to be closer than association, although a wide
                      range of degrees of intimacy exists in friendships, arch-enemies, and associations. Friendship and
                      association can be thought of as spanning across the same continuum. The study of friendship is
                      included in the fields of sociology, social psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and zoology.
                      Even animals have familiars! Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, among
                      which are social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles. In
                      Russia, one typically bestows very few people the status of “friend”.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>These friendships, however, make up in intensity what they lack in number. Friends
                      are entitled to call each other by their first names alone, and to use diminutives. A customary
                      example of polite behavior is addressing “acquaintances” by full first name plus their patronymic.
                      These could include relationships which elsewhere would be qualified as real friendships, such as
                      workplace relationships of long standing, or neighbors with whom one shares an occasional meal or
                      a social drink with.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>Also in the Middle East and Central Asia, male friendships, while less restricted
                      than in Russia, tend to be reserved and respectable in nature. They may use nicknames and
                      diminutive forms of their first names. In countries like India, it is believed in some parts that
                      friendship is a form of respect, not born out of fear or superiority. Friends are people who are
                      equal in most standards, but still respect each other regardless of their attributes or
                      shortcomings. Most of the countries previously mentioned (Russia, Asia, and even the Middle East)
                      and even our own nation are suffering a decline in genuine friendships.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>According to a study documented in the June 2006 issue of the Journal American
                      Sociological Review, Americans are thought to be suffering a loss in the quality and quantity of
                      close friendships since at least 1985. The study’s results state that twenty-five percent of
                      Americans have no close confidants, and the average total number of confidants per citizen has
                      dropped from four to two. According to the study, Americans’ dependence on family as a safety net
                      went up from fifty-seven percent to eighty percent; Americans dependence on a partner or spouse
                      went up from five percent to nine percent.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>Recent studies have found a link between fewer friendships, especially in quality,
                      and psychological and physiological regression. In the sequence of the emotional development of
                      the individual, friendships come after parental bonding and before the pair bonding engaged in at
                      the approach of maturity. In the intervening period between the end of early childhood and the
                      onset of full adulthood, friendships are often the most important relationships in the emotional
                      life of the adolescent, and are often more intense than relationships experienced later in life.
                    </p>
                    <p class='quote'>Unfortunately, making friends seems to trouble many of people. Having no friends
                      can be emotionally damaging for all ages, from young children to full grown adults. A study
                      performed by researchers from Purdue University found that post-secondary-education friendships,
                      college and university last longer than the friendships before it. Children with Asperger syndrome
                      and autism usually have some difficulty forming friendships. Socially crippling conditions like
                      these are just one way that the social world is so difficult to thrive in. This does not mean that
                      they are not able to form friendships, however. With time, moderation and proper instruction, they
                      are able to form friendships after realizing their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                    <p class='quote'>There is a number of theories that attempt to explain the link, including that:
                      Good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; Good friends encourage their
                      friends to seek help and access services, when needed; Good friends enhance their friend’s coping
                      skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and/or Good friends actually affect
                      physiological pathways that are protective of health. Regardless of what we think, we can clearly
                      see that there are some ways that friends, best friends and archenemies are the same, but in the
                      end they are clearly more different. Nonetheless we all have every single type in our lives.</p>

                        activist David Kennedy talks with Ben Crair about his new book, </b>Don’t Shoot<b>, criticism of
                        his plan, and the economics of gangs.</b></p>
                    <p class='quote'>In 1995, David M. Kennedy went to Boston on behalf of* Harvard’s Kennedy School of
                      Government to study violent crime. Like many American cities at that time, Boston was suffering a
                      wave of homicides. After linking up with a special Boston Police Department task force, Kennedy
                      and his team recognized that most of the killing was the work of a small handful of identifiable
                      gang members. Rather than locking them all up, they tried something new: They met with the gang
                      members and community leaders, offered <b>them</b> assistance in getting off the streets, and
                      warned them that, if any single gang member committed another murder*, they would crack down* on
                      the entire group. Crime dropped almost overnight, and Kennedy’s “Operation Ceasefire,” as it has
                      come to be known, <b>has been implemented</b> in more than 70 cities, addressing issues from gun
                      violence to drug markets to juvenile robberies. Now, Kennedy recounts his experiences in a new
                      book, <b>Don’t Shoot</b>: One Man, a Street Fellowship, and the End of Violence in Inner-City
