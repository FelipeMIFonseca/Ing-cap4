              Do you prefer one hundred
              <i>reais</i>
              in your wallet or a hundred friends in life? In Spain, according to an old saying, “With the money ending,
              the friendship ends”, while, in Russia, there is another adage: “Instead of having one hundred rubles, it
              is better to have one hundred friends.”
            </p>
            <p class="general-text">Americans use the word “friend” in a very general way, both for casual acquaintances
              and close friends, and friendship is subject to changes in intensity as people move, change jobs, marry or
              discover new interests. Yet, in China, the word “pengyou” (friend) is used only to refer to a person who
              is known and trusted by the speaker for several years. Still, in all countries, sharing experiences is
              usually the basis for making a friend. </p>
            <p class="general-text">Friendships are meaningful anywhere, and, for teens, especially, it’s important to
              feel a sense of belonging and acceptance by their peers. Having a network of friends, supporting family
              and caring teachers may help students avoid negative relationships, such as the abusive behavior of
              bullies. Learning positive friendship skills can be socially helpful and make teenagers feel happier and
              more conﬁdent.</p>

              A verb is a word that expresses an action or a state of being. It can be considered as one of the most
              important parts of a sentence, and it is for sure the most important part of the predicate, as you have
              learned in Portuguese. There are also the
              <b>helping</b>
              or
              <b>auxiliary verbs</b>
              , that help the action or linking verbs (an auxiliary verb + a verb is called a
              <b>verb phrase</b>
              ).
            </p>
            <p class="general-text">
              Look at the following sentences and underline the verbs in them.

              One easy way to help you recognize a verb is looking at its location compared to the subject. Verbs
              usually come after a noun or pronoun. These nouns and pronouns are referred to as the subject of the
              sentence. <br>
              Check the example:
            </p>

            <p class="general-text">
              The verb “thought” comes after the noun “Jack”, so the action Jack (subject) was performing was “thinking”
              (verb). <br>
              There are more than ten different types of verbs that are grouped together by function. Take a look at
              five of the most common ones.

                Everyone can use a friend or two. Having a few friends is great, but having a best friend is even
                better. From wacky adventures to great memories, a best friend can always find a way to magically put a
                smile on your face. Best friends are the people we deeply trust, the ones who we laugh with, cry to, and
                tell our deepest and darkest secrets to.

                foundations; but neither is it like primary school, where you can just go up to someone in the

                years later, during an intense emo phase. We have all evolved from being teenagers who listened to My
                Chemical Romance on our Sony Ericssons in the park to adults with jobs and, for one of us, a baby. It’s

                <p class="general-text">
                  Not only older people benefit form friendship, people of all ages do. With good friends, we can drop
                  our masks and be imperfect, without judgement. This lowers stress level, improves the immune system,
                  the attentional focus, as well as the physical and mental performance.
                  In pairs, try to find an explanation for why people with fewer or no friends tend to become sick
                  easier.

            <div class="quote">
              <p class="quote">The challenge of conducting future military operations within megacities (cities with
                populations over ten million) lies in understanding the dynamic and multidimensional complexities of
                these urban areas. Military operations in megacities, whether combat-oriented or otherwise, will be
                similar to those
                in other urban environments, but will be complicated by factors unique to the megacity environment.
              </p>
              <p class="quote">First and foremost, megacities are largely multilingual. While this can be said of large
                cities in general, the scale of multilingualism in megacities magnifies its effects. For instance, in
                New York City (NYC) – a metropolitan megacity of over eighteen million people – nine foreign languages
                are spoken by communities of one hundred thousand or larger. Language also plays a role in determining
                one’s identity and the language community in which one decides to live. For example, the majority of
                Russian speakers in NYC tend to live in south Brooklyn and Staten Island, while Chinese speakers tend to
                cluster in Manhattan and Sunset Park. In megacities, language, culture, and regional context go hand in
                hand and often reach beyond ethnic identities.</p>
              <p class="quote">In order to fully understand the context of a megacity, we must understand the role of
                the languages used in its communities. How ___________(1) language communities interact in megacities?
                What tensions ___________(2) caused by multiple language communities in urban space? What role
                ___________(3) language play in the power structures (government or otherwise) of megacities?</p>

              <p class="quote">The best way to recycle your plastic bags and film is to bring them back to a store that
                collects them for recycling. Just stuff them clean and dry into a single plastic bag, tie it up, and
                drop it into a plastic bag collection container found at the retail partners. Note: The stores listed
                below have partnered with King County to promote the Bag Your Bag campaign. There may be other stores
                not listed that accept plastic bags for recycling.
                Plastic bags and film collected at grocery stores stay cleaner and are easier for recycling facilities
                to process than bags placed in your home recycling collection bin. The bags are turned into new products
                like decking, benches, playground structures, and new plastic bags. And remember to bring along your
                reusable bags when you shop.
                The Bag your Bags, Bring ’em Back campaign is a partnership between the King County Solid Waste Division
                and local grocery stores to show the best way to recycle plastic bags.
